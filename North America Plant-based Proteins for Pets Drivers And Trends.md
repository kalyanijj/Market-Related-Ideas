<p><h2>North America Plant-based Proteins for Pets Market Driver and Trends</h2><p>The increasing awareness about the environmental impact of animal-based products is driving the adoption of plant-based proteins in the pet food industry. Consumers are becoming more conscious of sustainability and animal welfare, prompting pet food manufacturers to introduce plant-based alternatives. Additionally, plant-based proteins are seen as a healthier option, as they often contain fewer allergens and are easier to digest. This shift in consumer preferences is pushing brands to innovate and offer products that meet both ethical and nutritional standards, fueling market growth in North America.</p><p>Another key trend influencing the North American market is the rising demand for specialized diets among pets. With more pets suffering from food sensitivities, allergies, and obesity, pet owners are seeking plant-based proteins as a solution to these health issues. These proteins offer a cleaner, more natural alternative to traditional animal-based ingredients, which is appealing to health-conscious pet owners. As veterinary advice increasingly supports plant-based diets for pets, particularly those with specific health concerns, the demand for these products is expected to continue growing across the region.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=362606&utm_source=GitHub-Jan&utm_medium=291" target="_blank">North AmericaPlant-based Proteins for Pets Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;North AmericaPlant-based Proteins for Pets Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Plant-based Proteins for Pets Market size was valued at USD 1.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 4.6 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 15.0% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;North AmericaPlant-based Proteins for Pets Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Kerry</Li><Li> Glanbia</Li><Li> Roquette</Li><Li> Archer-Daniels Midland</Li><Li> Cargill</Li><Li> Burcon Nutrascience</Li><Li> Cosucra Groupe Warcoing</Li><Li> Ingredion</Li><Li> Crown Soya Protein</Li><Li> CHS</Li><Li> The Scoular</Li><Li> Fuji Oil</Li><Li> Ag Processing</Li><Li> Wilmar</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;North AmericaPlant-based Proteins for Pets Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the North AmericaPlant-based Proteins for Pets Market apart.
